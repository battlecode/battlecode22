# Battlecode 2022

ðŸš©

## Note, Competitors
This is the development repo! You most likely won't need anything in here; do not clone this.
Instead, follow the instructions [here](https://play.battlecode.org/getting-started) to get started.

## Repository Structure

- `/engine`: Game engine in Java
- `/specs`: Game specs in Markdown (and HTML generation)
- `/schema`: Game serialization schema (basically, an encoding of all units and events in a game)
- `/client`: Game client (visualizer and playback) in TypeScript
- `/example-bots`: A bunch of example bots for the game!

## Development

### Website

While it isn't strictly necessary, running is easier with [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed. If you have Windows, I'd also recommend installing [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/), since we have some scripts and programs that won't work with the standard Windows command prompt. (Docker is not strictly necessary, but it makes stuff easier, especially the backend.)

It's easiest to run the frontend and backend individually, in a separate terminal window for each. For instructions on how to do this, see each of their directories' readmes.

You could also run both the backend and the frontend in a single Docker container, by running `docker-compose up --build`. But, it's better to run them individuallly.

### Engine

Windows users: Instead of `./gradlew`, use `gradlew` for all commands.

(whenever Gradle has problems with something, run `./gradlew clean` and see if it helps)

To run a game, run

```
./gradlew headless
```

The replay file will be in `/matches`. Use `headlessX` for bots that are in `battlecode20-internal-test-bots`. You can specify the robot code and map like this: `./gradlew headless -Pmaps=maptestsmall -PteamA=examplefuncsplayer -PteamB=examplefuncsplayer`.

### Client

(Make sure you have a recent version of `npm`: `sudo npm cache clean -f && sudo npm install -g n && sudo n stable && PATH="$PATH"`.)

Navigate to the `client` folder and run `npm run install-all`. You can then run

```
npm run watch
```

which will launch the client on http://localhost:8080 (if available).

### Docs

You can generate javadocs as follows:

```
./gradlew release_docs_zip -Prelease_version=2020.0.0.0.0.1
```

This will create a `zip` file. Unzip and open the `index.html` file in it to view the docs. In particular, looking at the documentation for `RobotController` will be helpful.

To deploy these docs, get the above zip file, and unzip it. Rename the resulting folder to `javadoc`. Then, put it in `frontend/public`, suchh that there's a `frontend/public/javadoc/index.html`. Then run the frontend deploy process!

TODO -- these steps ought to simply be in the frontend deploy script.

## Notes for porting to a new repo

When the next edition of Battlecode comes around, it will probably useful to reuse a fair amount of this codebase. Maintaining git history is nice. Use `git-filter-repo` for this:

```
pip3 install git-filter-repo
```

Make sure you have a recent git version (run `git --version` and make sure it's compatible with git-filter-repo).

As an example, the following steps were taken to port from `battlehack20` to this repo:

First, create a fresh `battlecode21` repo on GitHub. Clone it. Then, starting in that repo:

```
cd ..
git clone https://github.com/battlecode/battlehack20 battlehack20-export
cd battlehack20-export
git filter-repo --tag-rename '':'bh20-'
cd ..
cd battlecode21
git pull ../battlehack20-export â€”allow-unrelated-histories
```

(Git filter-repo can do lots of cool things; see its documenation, old examples in our repo, etc. for ideas. For example, renaming directories is possible. )

Then, port all of the codebase! Don't forget to update the files in the highest level of the repo too, such as this readme itself, and the release script.
